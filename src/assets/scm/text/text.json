  "campaign_text": "On Jan. 24, Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant announced at a press conference at City Hall new legislation to prohibit caste-based discrimination in the city of Seattle. If passed, the ordinance would add caste to the city’s list of protected classes, outlawing discrimination in employment, housing, public places and contracting. It would also empower the Seattle Office for Civil Rights to investigate complaints of caste discrimination and facilitate a settlement for monetary damages or other forms of recompense.\n\nLast May, Real Change reported that caste remains a hidden and underreported issue among South Asian communities in the Seattle area. In recent years, anti-caste advocates have won important victories in the United States, such as California’s 2020 lawsuit against megacorporation Cisco for caste-based discrimination and the recognition of caste as a protected status by the California State University system in 2022.",
